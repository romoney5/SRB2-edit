# Installation:

You can compile the source code normally (see "Compiling") and put the binary in your SRB2 directory. No additional assets required, it works right out the box!

# Changes

## HUD
- CEchos/CSays print message into console ("`showcsays`")
- Joining netgame shows progress bar on "checking files" ([Lugent's PR](https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2/-/merge_requests/2446) [Lugent's PR](https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2/-/merge_requests/2556))
- Easily rejoin servers you've played before! ("`connect last`", Multiplayer -> Rejoin Previous Servers...)
- Draw gif information to hud ("`moviemodeinfo`")
- Crosshairs can invert pixels behind, to improve their visibility ("`crosshair_invert`" and "`crosshair2_invert`")

- Countdown beep isn't ear piercingly loud!
- Snake download game background fixed!
- Master Server list background for better readability!

## Gameplay / Netplay
- Skin change at any time
- Addfilelocal from SRB2K Saturn! (use "`addfilelocal`" command or press R-ALT in the addons menu)
- Minimum input delay from SRB2Kart Saturn/Ring Racers! ("`mindelay`")
- Improved startup times! (Code from [SRB2Classic](https://codeberg.org/srb2classic/srb2classic))
- "`cam_centertoggle`" and "`cam2_centertoggle`" are no longer exclusive to Automatic!
- See private messages as host! (Code from [SRB2Classic](https://codeberg.org/srb2classic/srb2classic))

## Modding and Debugging
- "`renderhitbox`" in multiplayer
- Lua HUD interpolation from SRB2K Saturn
- "`freezelevel`" debug command (Be careful using when clients are connected!)
- HUD camera struct updates position in first person! (credits [Jiskster](https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2/-/merge_requests/2629) & [Hanicef](https://git.do.srb2.org/Hanicef/SRB2Classic/-/commit/681bd160f5be3925a97d798d00e67b32a8c1df71))
- `v.cachePatch` accepts a second parameter for rotation! (https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2/-/merge_requests/2662)
- Added "`TR`" as an alias to "`TICRATE`" in Lua
- "`getlogfile`" command (Prints the absolute path of the current log, useful when latest-log.txt is sym-linked to a different log)

## GIFs
- Adjustable gif size cap, toggable too! (`gif_maxsize`, "Max GIF Size (MB)")
    - ^ When gif is capped, gif_rolling allows for another gif to immediately start! (`gif_rolling`, "Keep recording when capped")
- Pause GIFs *WHILE* Recording! (Bound to F2 by default)

## Console && Misc. Commands
- `help` now lists commands and variables by origin. Parameters are as follows:
  | Param      | Desc      |
  | ------------- | ------------- |
  | `-v` | Only show variables and/or commands from vanilla SRB2 only.  |
  | `-c` | Only show variables and/or commands that are in SRB2-edit, and not vanilla. |
  | `-a` | Only show variables and/or commands created by addons |

- Console variables can no longer be used as an argument for `help`, they now print their info instead of just their current and default value. "`cvarinfo`" lets you hide the flags and origin sections ("Show All" by default).
- "`cycle`" command (`cycle <cvar> [values]`): Inaccessible by Lua. Cycles given values on the cvar if the current value is found in the list (also loops around). Fails if the current value is not found, unless `-b` is specified (starts at the first arg if so).

# Lua Additions

## Global variables
- "`takis_custombuild`" (Read only) (boolean) :  Global to detect if the client is using this build
- "`takis_complexlocaladdons`" (Read only) (boolean) : Global to detect if the client has loaded local addons with lua in them
- "`takis_locallyloading`" (Read only) (boolean) : Only set during script loading, detects whether the script is being loaded locally

  Example:
  ```lua
  if (takis_locallyloading) then
    --do local stuff here
    return
  end
  --normal, gameplay editing code
  ```
- "`demoplayback`" (Read only) (boolean) : True if viewing a demo.

## Functions
- `P_GetLocalAiming(player_t player)` : Returns the angle_t `aiming` of `player` if they are a local player. Returns 0 otherwise.
- `P_GetLocalAngle(player_t player)` : Returns the angle_t `angle` of `player` if they are a local player. Returns 0 otherwise.

- `R_CreateTranslation(string name, string translations...)` : Adds a custom translation, using the same parser as TRNSLATE.
- `R_RemoveTranslation(string name)` : Removes a custom translation. Can only remove translations made by Lua.
- `R_TranslationExists(string name)` : Returns true if a custom translation with a given name exists, false if not.

- `io.openlump(string filename, [string mode])` : Similar to `io.openlocal`, but reads a lump inside any addon loaded. Two new options are supported: `f` to scan addons forward from start to end, and `m` to only search in game-modifying addons.

  Example:
  ```lua
  local file = io.openlump("lua/main.lua","r")
  
  if file
  	local dat = file:read("*a")
  	print("Length: "..dat:len())
  	file:close()
  else
  	print("Could not read lump")
  end
  ```

- `v.interpolate/v.interpLatch(boolean/int)` : See [SRB2K Saturn's documentation](https://github.com/Indev450/SRB2Kart-Saturn/blob/Saturn/LUASTUFF.md)
- `v.drawFixedFill` : Same as `v.drawFill`, but x, y, width, and height arguments are all in fixed point scale.
### For "uncappedgame" HUD hooks:
- `v.timeFraction()` : Returns the value of `rendertimefrac` [0, FRACUNIT]. "The fraction of a tic being drawn (for interpolation between two tics)"
- `v.deltaTics()` : Returns the value of `renderdeltatics`. "Evaluated delta tics for this frame (how many tics since the last frame)"
- `v.isNewTic()` : Returns whether the current render is the start of a new gamelogic tic or not. (boolean)
- `v.usingInterpolation()` : Returns whether or not frame interpolation is enabled. (boolean)

Example script that uses manual interpolation:
```lua
local scroll = 0
addHook("HUD",function(v,p,cam)
	local width = (v.width() / v.dupx())*FU
	if v.isNewTic()
		scroll = ($ + 4*FU) % width
	end
	local x = (scroll + (4*v.timeFraction())) % width
	v.drawScaled(x, 100*FU, FU, v.cachePatch("MISSING"),V_SNAPTOLEFT)

	v.drawScaled(scroll, 140*FU, FU, v.cachePatch("MISSING"),V_SNAPTOLEFT)
end,"uncappedgame")
```

- `M_Random`* : Same as `v.Random*` functions, except also client-sided and not limited to HUD hooks.

## Hooks
- `"uncappedgame"` : A new hud hook that runs during gameplay, except not bound to the 35 fps limit. Introduces new functions into the draw for manual interpolation. (WIP)

## mobj_t
- `mobj.pitch/roll` : Now rotates mobjs in 3D space, including models
- `mobj.resetinterp` : Resets ALL interpolation values. (`P_SetOrigin` only resets positional interpolation values)


Example that tilts your character in their 3D direction:
```lua
addHook("PlayerThink",function(p)
    local me = p.mo
    if not (me and me.valid) then return end

    local angle = R_PointToAngle2(0,0, me.momx,me.momy)
    local mang = R_PointToAngle2(0,0, FixedHypot(me.momx, me.momy), me.momz)
    mang = InvAngle($)

    me.roll = FixedMul(mang, sin(angle))
    me.pitch = FixedMul(mang, cos(angle))
end)
```

## player_t
- `player.ipaddress` (string) (read only): For use in moderation addons, this only returns a string for the server of the players IP address. Clients _cannot_ see other clients' IP addresses. The only way for other clients to know is if the server sends a command with them or something :p
- `player.muted` (boolean) (read + write): Returns whether or not the player is muted. (though changes may not be reflected in servers not running edit)


## renderflags_t
- `RF_ALWAYSONTOP` : The sprite always draws on top of level geometry and other sprites. Not supported for models, and culled sprites wont be rendered. Note that in OpenGL, anything transparent will render on any `RF_ALWAYSONTOP` sprites
- `RF_HIDEINSKYBOX` : The sprite will be hidden in the skybox.
- `RF_NOMODEL` : The sprite will be forced to not use a model in OpenGL.


## eflags_t
- `MFE_NOPITCHROLLEASING` : When "pitchroll-easing" is toggled, adding this eflag will not ease the pitch/roll axis this tic. Removed at the end of MobjThinker.
